What is this?
-------------

This is an archival repository of the ASURA-I µITRON TSR, authored by Mineyuki Kimoto in 1994.

The only remaining archive can be found here:

Changes
-------

This repository used [`nkf`](https://github.com/nurse/nkf) to re-encode the original files to UTF-8 for convenience.

In addition, the documentation text files were roughly translated using machine translation.

The source code files were otherwise untouched.

> **TIP**: For use within a DOS environment, you should either use the
> original archive, or the commit before conversion to UTF-8.


License
-------

Close to 30 years after its original release, the author (Mineyuki Kimoto) agreed to relicense for the sake of archiving.
